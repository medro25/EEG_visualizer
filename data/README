The Bitbrain Open Access Sleep (BOAS) dataset.

## Overview

This project aimes at bridging the gap between gold-standard clinical sleep monitoring and emerging wearable EEG technologies. 
The dataset comprises 128 nights in which healthy participants were simultaneously monitored with two technologies: a Brain Quick Plus Evolution PSG system, by Micromed, and a wearable EEG headband, by Bitbrain. 
The Micromed PSG system provides a comprehensive and clinically validated set of sleep parameters, while the Bitbrain wearable EEG headband offers a user-friendly, self-administered alternative, limited to forehead EEG electrodes.

A relevant aspect of the dataset is the simultaneous acquisition of data from both systems, allowing for direct comparison and validation of the wearable EEG device against the established PSG standard. 
This dual-recording approach provides a rich resource for evaluating the performance and potential of wearable EEG technology in sleep studies.

To ensure robust and reliable sleep staging, we employed a rigorous labeling process. Three expert sleep scorers independently annotated the PSG recordings following the criteria developed by the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM) (Berry et al., 2015), and a consensus label was derived from these annotations by a fourth expert. This consensus labeling approach addresses the inherent variability in human sleep staging, which has an estimated inter-scorer agreement of approximately 85% (Danker-Hopfe et al., 2009; Rosenberg and Van Hout, 2013). The consensus labels were then applied to the corresponding wearable EEG recordings, leveraging the simultaneous data acquisition.
Moreover, we utilized a deep learning model to analyze the dataset (Esparza-Iaizzo et al., 2024). By implementing a cross-validation procedure, we trained and validated the model separately on the PSG and wearable EEG datasets. The model achieved an 87.08% match between the human-consensus labels and the network-provided labels for the PSG data, and an 86.64% match for the wearable EEG data.

Our dataset, therefore, includes:

	1. Raw and labeled PSG recordings from 128 nights.
	
	2. Raw and labeled wearable EEG recordings from the same nights.
	
	3. Human-consensus sleep stage labels for both PSG and wearable EEG data.
	
	4. AI-generated sleep stage labels for both datasets.


## Format

The dataset is formatted according to the Brain Imaging Data Structure. 

The folder of each participant contains the data recorded with the PSG (sub-xx_task-Sleep_acq-psg_eeg.edf) and with the wearable EEG headband (sub-xx_task-Sleep_acq-headband_eeg.edf). 
Note that not all the PSG sensors were used with all the participants. The full list of available sources of activity for each recording can be obtained on the 'channels.tsv' file. 

Meaning of all the channel groups:

	- PSG_EEG: EEG signals recorded with the PSG system. Channels available are F3, F4, C3, C4, O1, O2 (PSG_F3;PSG_F4;PSG_C3;PSG_C4;PSG_O1;PSG_O2).
	- PSG_EOG: EOG signals recorded with the PSG system. Some of the participants have just one EOG derivation (PSG_EOG), whereas others have 2 lateral derivations, referenced to the mastoid (PSG_EOGR;PSG_EOGL).
	- PSG_EMG: EMG signals recorded with the PSG system. One chin EMG derivation is available (PSG_EMG).
	- PSG_BELTS: Breathing activity recorded the PSG system using breathing belts. Abdominal and thoracic breathing belts were used (PSG_ABD;PSG_THOR).
	- PSG_THER: Respiratory airflow recorded with the PSG system using a thermistor (PSG_THER).
	- PSG_CAN: Respiratory airflow recorded with the PSG system using a nasal cannula (PSG_CAN).
	- PSG_PPG: Photopletismographic activity recorded with the PSG system. Channels available are pulse (PSG_PULSE), heart beat (PSG_BEAT) and oxygen saturation (PSG_SPO2).

	- HB_EEG: EEG signals recorded with the wearable EEG headband. The headband measuring locaations are equivalent to AF7 and AF8 (HB_1;HB_2).
	- HB_IMU: Movement activity recorded  from an accelerometer and gyroscope. Both sensors record in 3 dimensions (x, y, z) each,  (HB_IMU_1;HB_IMU_2;HB_IMU_3;HB_IMU_4;HB_IMU_5;HB_IMU_6)
	- HB_PULSE: Pulse activity recorded with the wearable EEG headband using a PPG sensor (HB_PULSE).

The sleep stages of each night are coded as events at the corresponding recording folder. The sleep stages obtained as the consensus of the three experts, as well as the labels obtained by the AI using the EEG activity recorded with the PSG can be found in the 'sub-xx_task-Sleep_acq-psg_events.tsv' files. The sleep stages obtained by the AI using the EEG activity recorded with the wearable headband can be found in the 'sub-xx_task-Sleep_acq-headband_events.tsv' files.
